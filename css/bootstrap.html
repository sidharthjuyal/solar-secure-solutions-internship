As per Wikipedia, A CSS framework is a library allowing for easier, more standards-compliant web
design using the Cascading Style Sheets language. 

In simple terms, a CSS framework is basically a collection of CSS code which a person or an
organisation has already written for us to use. The benefit of using those pieces of CSS code is that
it will be of good standard (if it has been written by an experienced coder or good organisation) and
it will make our work very easy because we will not have to write that piece of CSS again.

Generally, these CSS frameworks will be a collection of CSS classes which when used for our html
elements, the style will be automatically applied.
One of the most popular CSS Frameworks which is used today is called Bootstrap. As mentioned in
Wikipedia definition, most of these CSS frameworks come with a grid system and Bootstrap is no
exception.

The grid system is really useful. Bootstrap divides the screen into 12 different columns and you can
then place your content in one or more columns by using certain classes. This helps us in placing
our content on the web page as we desire with very less hassle.

As a coder, it will be imperative for you in future to understand concepts like these on your own
once the foundation or basics is clear. Therefore, I will request you to google search Bootstrap grid
system and use whatever you have learnt so far to understand the Bootstrap grid concept, and
what classes are used to place content in those grids.

Please Note: We include Bootstrap just like we included external style.css in one of our last lectures.

To include external bootstrap css in your html file, you can write this line just before the line where
we included style.css (This line points to a hosted Bootstrap css file from the internet):
